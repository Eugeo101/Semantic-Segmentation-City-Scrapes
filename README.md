This project focuses on semantic segmentation for **street scene images** using TensorFlow. The model is trained to classify each pixel of an image into one of the 30 predefined classes. These classes represent objects like roads, sidewalks, vehicles, traffic signs, etc. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training with data augmentation, and evaluation with Intersection over Union (IoU) and accuracy metrics.

## üìù Problem Statement  
Given images from a street scene dataset, the goal is to classify each pixel into one of the following classes:
- **Static objects** like buildings and fences.
- **Roads, sidewalks, and other infrastructure** like rail tracks and bridges.
- **Moving objects** like cars, trucks, cyclists, and pedestrians.

## üîç Steps Followed  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading  
- The dataset consists of **2097 training images** and **500 validation images**.  
- The images are loaded using TensorFlow‚Äôs image loading functions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- **Image and Mask Creation**: For each image, a corresponding mask image is created, where each pixel is labeled with an integer corresponding to a class.
- **Image Normalization**: The pixel values are normalized to the range `[0, 1]`.
- **Mask Processing**: Masks are converted into one-hot encoded arrays for model compatibility.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Creation with `tf.data` API  
- The dataset is prepared using TensorFlow's `tf.data` API for fast and efficient data loading and batching.
- Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling are applied during training.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building  
- The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for semantic segmentation, which predicts the class of each pixel in an image.
- The model architecture includes several convolutional layers, followed by upsampling layers to match the output size of the input image.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Training with On-the-Fly Augmentation  
- Training is performed with real-time data augmentation using TensorFlow‚Äôs built-in methods.
- The model is trained with **Adam optimizer** and **IoU (Intersection over Union)** as the primary evaluation metric.
- The **visualization_callback** function is used to visualize the model's progress after each epoch.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation and Saving  
- After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set using **IoU** and **accuracy**.
- The trained model weights are saved for future use.

## üìä Results  
The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Train IoU**: 0.4801  
- **Train Accuracy**: 0.8874  
- **Validation IoU**: 0.3255  
- **Validation Accuracy**: 0.8321  

### Performance Comparison  
- **TensorFlow vs Numpy**: TensorFlow operations were compared with their Numpy equivalents, showing that TensorFlow operations are **significantly faster** (e.g., TensorFlow processed all images in 0.78 seconds, while Numpy took 240 seconds).
